# Bikesharing Experience

## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

 The idea of Bikesharing was started in 1965 in  Amsterdam according to the website, SmartCities.com. This idea has now spread all over the world, even in a small city of Falls Church, Virginia. In this Challenge 14, three deliverables are completed and in the end the following website is created which shows the work done for this challenge:

 The graphs do show that the check out time is maximum for 30 minutes and males dominate the graph in terms of the number of males taking advantage. Also at the same time number of females are using Bikesharing service at various times in a day.

 There are also four more graphs presented which show (1) Trips by Weekday per Hour, (2) Trips by Weekday per hour, (3) User Trips by Gender and (4) Dashboard as follows:

 Deliverable 3:

 Our images show that for 2019 the Bikesharing business did well at least in terms of response from males and females, and also the business was active through out the day and night. And we are encouraged to recommend this business to the other cities, including for Des Moines (Iowa). It would have been nice if we had the data till the recent year, 2020 and we could have studied the trend. The fact that Bikesharing has started in Falls Church City two years back only confirms the growing trend all over the USA.
